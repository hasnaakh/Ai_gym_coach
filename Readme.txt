In Anaconda:
1. Make environment in Anaconda and choose python==3.8.19.
2. Install libraries and packages that is in requirements.txt file.
3. Install jupyter notbook.


In jupyter notebook start run:-

To train the model:
1. Import and Install Dependencies "In one line to be incompatible with each other" .
2. Keypoints using MP Pose "Press q to stop the webcam that opens to capture keypoints".
3. Extract Keypoint Values.
4. Setup Folders for Collection "Choose the actions you want to make and number of sequence for each action and the sequence length".
5. Collect Keypoint Values for Training and Testing "Collect the data".
6. Preprocess Data and Create Labels and Features.
7. Build and Train LSTM Neural Network.
7b. LSTM + Attention.
8. Save Weights "This is your model".
8b. Load Weights.
9. Make Predictions.
10. Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy.
10a. Confution Matrices.
10b. Accuracy.
10c. Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
11. Choose Model to Test in Real Time.
12. Test in Real Time .

To test the model:
*Install the model in your device 'LSTM_Attention_128HUs.h5'*
1. Import and Install Dependencies "In one line to be incompatible with each other" .
2. Keypoints using MP Pose "Press q to stop the webcam that opens to capture keypoints".
3. Extract Keypoint Values.
"Skip until reach 11."
11. Choose Model to Test in Real Time "Run only the commented code that in it".
"set a number of colors appropriate to the number of actons you have in the model "
12. Test in Real Time .
